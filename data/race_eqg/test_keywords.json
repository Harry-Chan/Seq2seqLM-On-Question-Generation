( more americans vacation m july than any other month . ) there are a few explanations why people might time their marital dissolutions this way , it might just be too difficult to announce a divorce around family-oriented christmas time , especially if there are kids involved , so many couples weigh the decision to divorce around the new year and progress from there . february is a period in which couples tend to look around for representation on legal sites . and by march , they're prepared to file for divorce . but the authors think the more likely reason is that people decide their differences are irreconcilable right after a big trip . it could be that people don't want to ruin a family getaway , or that vacations are so stressful that they drive the already-dissatisfied to divorce . ( \" i told you to pack your suitcase last night ; now we've missed the train ! \" ) then there's the \" broken promise \" theory . \" 6people are discontent with their marriages , they look at vacation as an opportunity to give it one last shot , and what they were hoping would happen didn't occur , \" explained brines , an associate professor of sociology . it's not you ; in other words , it's your failure to print the boarding passes .",
